 ## Description
 
Eloy-app is a web application showcasing artistic creations, which include paintings, sculptures, and jewelry. The platform provides visitors with an engaging visual experience to explore and appreciate the various works of art.

### Key Features

- **Home Page with Carousel:** The homepage features a carousel showcasing highlighted pieces created by my father. This section gives visitors a visual preview of some of the most notable artworks.

- **Specialized Galleries:** EÃ±oy-app offers three specialized galleries, each dedicated to a specific artistic specialty (paintings, sculptures, and jewelry). Each gallery allows users to explore all the works corresponding to that category.

This application provides art enthusiasts with an interactive platform to discover and enjoy the unique creations.
